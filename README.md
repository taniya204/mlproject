Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using Python, EasyOCR, and OpenCV

Overview

The goal of this project is to provide an accessible and reliable ANPR solution that can be easily integrated into various applications and systems. By combining the capabilities of Python, EasyOCR, and OpenCV, this project aims to simplify the implementation of license plate recognition for developers and organizations.

Usage

Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), also known as License Plate Recognition (LPR), is a versatile technology with a wide range of applications. ANPR systems are designed to automatically detect, read, and interpret license plates from vehicles. 
Traffic Management: Monitoring and optimizing traffic flow.
Law Enforcement and Security: Identifying vehicles involved in crimes.
Parking Facilities: Automating entry, exit, and payment processes.
Toll Collection: Charging tolls electronically at toll booths.
Access Control: Regulating entry to gated areas and facilities.
Smart Cities: Enhancing traffic signals and enforcing environmental regulations.
Vehicle Tracking: Managing fleets and rental vehicles.
Retail and Marketing: Analyzing customer demographics and behaviors.
Event Management: Handling traffic and parking at large events.
Data Collection: Conducting traffic studies and informing urban planning.
